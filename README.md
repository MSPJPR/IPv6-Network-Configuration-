This project is an interactive web-based dashboard designed to help users understand and simulate key concepts related to Next Generation IP Networks (IPv6). Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project demonstrates IPv6 addressing, packet transmission, security mechanisms, and congestion control visualization. The project leverages libraries like D3.js for diagram visualization and Chart.js for dynamic charting, making complex network concepts more intuitive and visually engaging.

Key Features

1. IPv6 Address Allocation Simulator:

Description: Allows users to input an IPv6 address and validates the format.

Interactive Diagram: Uses D3.js to generate a diagram displaying the IPv6 address structure.

Purpose: Helps users understand the IPv6 addressing architecture and allocation formats.

2. IPv6 Packet Transmission Simulation:

Description: Simulates packet transmission across a network with a simple visual animation.

Purpose: Demonstrates how IPv6 packets move through the network, aiding in understanding of routing and data flow.

3. IPv6 Security Demonstration:

Description: Provides an overview of IPv6 security mechanisms like the Authentication Header (AH) and Encapsulation Security Payload (ESP).

Purpose: Highlights key IPv6 security protocols for secure communication.

4. Congestion Control Visualization:

Description: Visualizes congestion control techniques using a dynamic line chart powered by Chart.js.

Purpose: Helps users understand how queue lengths evolve over time and how congestion is managed in networks.

5. Mobile Responsiveness:

Description: The design ensures the dashboard functions smoothly on both desktop and mobile devices.


Technologies Used

HTML5: For structuring the web pages.

CSS3: For styling and ensuring mobile responsiveness.

JavaScript: For interactive functionality and dynamic content.

D3.js: For creating data-driven visualizations (IPv6 diagrams).

Chart.js: For visualizing congestion control data with charts.

Why This Project Stands Out

1. Interactive Learning: Combines visual diagrams, animations, and dynamic charts to simplify complex IPv6 concepts.


2. Real-World Simulation: Offers practical demonstrations of IPv6 addressing, transmission, and security mechanisms.


3. Mobile-Friendly: Can be executed directly on mobile devices using Termux, making it accessible anywhere.


4. Enhancements: Integrates advanced visualization techniques to engage and impress professors or peers.
